        100 million times per day on phones, tablets,

        the <strong>one-touch build system</strong>,
        <strong>graduated roll-out</strong> mechanism,
        <strong>SuperPack</strong> IP-protection and compression system,
        <strong>TDD</strong> coverage over 90%, and
        <strong>git hook</strong> which blocked commits

        >TypeBomb</a> is an SPA developed with my 8 year old son 
        to teach him VIM, typing, and HTML 5 development principles.
        It is currently in <strong>Alpha</strong>.
        The SPA uses many best practices, including
        <strong>TDD, linting, commit hooks, model events and handlers, 
        JS generated CSS, and a one-touch build system.</strong>
        To play, just pick a level and start typing!

        >The Fog of SPA</a> is one of many presentations.
        It shares seven hard-won lessons from designing and delivering five commercial 
        SPAs. It shows how design for quality, creative destruction, minimalism, 
        and targeted testing techniques can remove complexity and confusion 
        from SPA development.  Other recent presentations are found on

      <h3>Selected Acheivements</h3>
      <p class="msm-tight"><strong>Experienced and proven</strong> as an expert in
        Single Page Applications (SPA), UX, UI, ID, full-stack
        architecture, and development. CEO and founder of two startups.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Works to relentlessly reduce cycle times,</strong> 
        fail faster, and deliver a better product
        sooner. Here are a few objectives to meet this goal:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Focus on language mastery</strong> instead of
          <i>silver bullet</i> frameworks and libraries with 
          complex and buggy Domain Specific Languages [DSLs].
          Use fewer, high quality, focused, and mature tools instead.</li>
        <li><strong>Strive for a "one-touch" build system.</strong>
          Build times for a JS project should not exceed 5 minute.
          Ten seconds is even better.</li>
        <li><strong>Architect and code for TDD.</strong> Don't
          use TDD too early in a project because there's little value
          in testing prototype code. But when you get do use TDD, a little
          forethought can cut cycle times by <strong>days.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Strive for automatic unit tests that provide good coverage
          and run fast.</strong> Don't test system logic with incredibly 
          expensive UI tests (e.g. Selinium).  Use headless testing for that.</li>
        <li><strong>Use commit hooks to block sub-par code.</strong>
          The commit hook should, at the minimum, run regression tests and 
          lint tests on all production code.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a SCMS that encourages branching.</strong>
        <li><strong>Favor a smaller, focused, full-time, colocated
          team</strong> over larger, part-time, dispersed team.
          If the team can't share the same facilities, the closer the time zones
          the better.</li>
        <li><strong>Embrace meaningful and clear code standards</strong>
          so that developers can collaborate.</li>
        <li><strong>Employ strategic pair-programming and peer code
        review.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Be pragmatic, not religious.</strong>
          Get stuff done by leaving comments for future improvements instead
          of getting stuck on optimizing too early.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Researched</strong> many tools and emerging technologies such as
        SVG, touch interfaces and libraries,

        Employed technologies such as frame rate pacing,
        proximity sensing, collision detection, sound design, responsive
        design to deliver enterprise software with an outstanding user
        experience for all level of users.
